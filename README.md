# Domestic violence in New South Wales, Australia

Domestic violence in our state is on the rise over the last five years, and shows a a distinct seasonal pattern. The annualised rate of domestic violence assaults has risen 3.85% over the last five years, based on comparing the Apr. 2019-Mar. 2020 reporting period to the Apr. 2015-Mar. 2016 period. 

The blue trend line in the figure below highlights the rising trend with smoothed values, while the black series visualizes actual monthly rates. The statewide rate of assaults per 100,000 people peaks each December. Economic and familial stresses collide late in the year, suggesting seasonal interventions may reduce overall incidence and recidivism.
