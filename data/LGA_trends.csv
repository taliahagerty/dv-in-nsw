"^ LGAs with populations lower than 3000 are excluded (indicated by 'nc') because rate calculations for these areas are very sensitive to small changes in population sizes and the number of incidents recorded. Rate calculations should also be treated very cautiously for LGAs that have high visitor numbers relative to their residential population. This is because rate calculations are based on estimated residential population and no adjustment has been made for the number of people visiting each LGA per year. For the rate calculations, specialised population data were prepared and provided to BOCSAR by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",,,,,,,,,
^^ Shows the results of a statistical test for a significant upward or downward trend in the monthly number of criminal incidents recorded. Where the trend is significant (i.e p<0.05) the average annual percentage change over the five and two year period is shown. Significant upward trends are highlighted in red; significant downward trends are highlighted in yellow. 'Stable' indicates there was no significant upward or downward trend and 'nc' indicates that the number of incidents recorded was too small for a reliable trend test to be performed.,,,,,,,,,
